# What's this and how do I use it?

Here are three files defining a "Custom HTML/CSS" for the streamlabs widget "donation goal"
To use it just copy the content of every file into the coresponding tab in the settings for [that widget in your streamlabs.com account](https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/donationgoal).

This custom HTML/CSS (and JavaScript) lets the widget fly into the browser and fade out again after a donation was done.
